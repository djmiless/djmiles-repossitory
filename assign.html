     GRIND KINGS ACTIVEWEAR FACE MASK

</h3>



<p class="paragraph">
	The newly emerging problems we face require new solutions with new directions, for the  love of exercises and sports Grind Kings, the first designers of urban personal protective  equipment, find it a necessity to provide sportswear face masks to mitigate the risk of  contracting bacteria and germs by sports lovers. The pandemic era has created a new  purveyor for the necessary personal protective equipment. There are lots of people in the game now, from fashion brands to bridal businesses who are bringing us new designs with  the latest trends.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
	Grind Kings is one of the leading purveyors in ensuring people's protection comes first while  they do their favorite exercise or sport. The Grind Kings' activewear face mask is known to be  an urban style and flows along with the latest trend in fashion.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
	The face mask was an absolute necessity for healthcare workers to protect them from contracting the virus from  their patients, but they ran out of supplies of facial masks like a  surgical mask which gave opportunities to fashion and brands to become purveyors of this  protective wear.   
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
	Activewear is for sports lovers and those who like exercises, but other people who have kin   interest in sport have incorporated it into their daily lifestyles such as going to the gym,  running, judging, biking, errands, and house core. With this, fashion has taken the supporting   position for our daily protection from the   pandemic COVID 19, while Grind Kings joins the protection providers in terms of personal protective equipment, Grind kings also makes it   own a grand style appealing to the eyes and beckoning to our emotions.
</p>
<P class="paragraph">
	Grind Kings' activewear provides added advantage to our face masks such as form and   functions by providing a facial shield and a purifier to its facial mask. Also, Grind Kings offer    logo-bearing to different versions of facial masks as it is now covetable among streetwear   fans.  
Seeing that cities all around have started opening back their shops and restaurants bringing    back our everyday delicious delicacy, the country still observes the quarantines process that    was created to help stop the pandemic coronavirus from spreading. One of the effective    methods was the use of a facial mask by people when they are out in the public, the CDC    recommended the use of a cloth facial covering for preventing the transmission or spread of    germs and viruses.
</P>
<p class="paragraph">
	But there are issues with the cloth facial mask. It can be worn as a shield on a walk, a trip to a   grocery store but can be used for physical activities. Most cloth masks are not breathable and   can likeably chaff the skin. Cloth mask can be heavy and saggy and can also fall from the face   if it is not secured fitly to the face. As a result, the reason for using a facial mask is lost in the   process
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
	To our marvels, there are some manufacturers such as Grind Kings and others bringing better   designs to fit in for physical activities. Grind Kings' activewear face mask has a design   specifically for cycling, running, and work out exercises. However, these activewear face   masks are not medical face masks, they can prevent you from dust, debris, or accidental  sprays but not designed for frontline workers such as doctors and nurses.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
	Why should you be selective about the facial mask as a sportsman or woman, or just a sports  lover or a fan of the latest trend and your protection? As a sports lover, you should be safe,  and comfortable while running, cycling, or working out using a face  mask. Also, your face mask should enable your flexibility as you bend and move with your exercise without falling  off, or get moisten. For these important reasons, Grind Kings' activewear provides three  important things you should look for in an activewear face mask.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
	<span class="subheader" id="Fabric"> Fabric: </span> the fabric is very important; you should look for a fabric made out of lightweight and   moisture-wicking materials. The fabric should be able to wick away your sweat and keep your   face dry and helpful. Also, the fabric must be stretchy a little for accommodating your   flexibility and mobility without falling off. Grind Kings chose the best fabric with the quality  stated above to ensure you get the best from a face mask without compromising its purpose.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
 <span class="subheader" id="Breathing"> Breathing: </span> Grind Kings' activewear face mask list collections are made from breathable fabrics  to ensure your safety from suffocation while it covers your nose and mouth. Among the  collections we have, there are some with special tiny perforated holes in the front with a  proportion to the nose for better breathing when working out.   
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
	<span class="subheader" id="Fitting"> Fitting:</span> Grind Kings' activewear facial mask provides an elastic strap fitted with the face mask   that can be used around the ear and adjustable to keep the mask tightly around the nose and mouth.   Also, some of our collection fits around your neck, and some are worn like hoods. 
Grind Kings' activewear face mask is the first urban designed mask that provides you    various design collections of a face mask without compromising the intent of the face mask.
